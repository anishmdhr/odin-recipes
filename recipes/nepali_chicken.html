        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the mustard oil in a pan. Add the cumin seeds, cloves,cardamom, cinnamon and bay leaf and fry for about 15-20 secs. Add the chopped onions and fry the onions till they become light pink and soft. Add the ginger and garlic and fry for another 5 mins.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces and fry till the chicken become  light brown. Now, add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, chilli powder, cumin powder, coriander powder and salt and mix well with the chicken. Fry for 3-5 mins, then lower the heat and cover the pan and cook for 10 mins. No need to add water at this stage as the chicken and tomatoes will leave water.
            </li>            
            <li>When the chicken is tender and the oil starts separating from the gravy. Add 1 and 1/2 cups of water ( about 300 ml) and let the chicken simmer for 10-15 mins. You can adjust the consistency of the gravy as desired.
            </li>
            <li>Serve garnished with chopped green coriander/Cilantro.
