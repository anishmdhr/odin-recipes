    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nepali chicken might be one of the most enjoyed dishes of the country.
        It is such a versatile dish which goes with anything.
        Rice, Chiura, Dhedo you name it. It is a dish that no one says no to(except vegetarians, you know what the fuss
        is about).
        When someone in the family says "Masu bhaat khaney", yeah they're probably going to have chicken curry.
        So why not learn the default dish of every household of Nepal?
        You know you want to, there's no denying it. Now, lets get stated.

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the mustard oil in a pan. Add the ginger
            and garlic and fry for another 5 mins.
        </li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds, cloves,cardamom, cinnamon and bay leaf and fry for about
            15-20 secs.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onions and fry the onions till they become light pink and soft.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic and fry for another 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and fry till the chicken become light brown.
        </li>
        <li>Now, add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric
            powder, chilli powder, cumin powder, coriander powder and salt and mix well with the chicken.</li>
        <li>Fry for 3-5
            mins, then lower the heat and cover the pan and cook for 10 mins. No need to add water at this stage as the
            chicken and tomatoes will leave water.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is tender and the oil starts separating from the gravy. Add 1 and 1/2 cups of water ( about
            300 ml) and let the chicken simmer for 10-15 mins. You can adjust the consistency of the gravy as desired.
