    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mo:Mo is a dumpling made of all-purpose flour and filled with either meat or vegetables. Inspired by Tibetan
        dumplings, the dish is a very popular Nepali street food.
    </p>
    <p>In Nepal the most common type of Mo:Mos are buff (buffalo) Mo:Mos followed by chicken. A few restaurants also
        offer
        special Mo:Mos such as pumpkin Mo:Mos or spinach & cheese Mo:Mos but non-veg Mo:Mos are still the favourite.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Preparing the fillings
            <ul>
                <li>Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.
                </li>
                <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat.
                </li>
                <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.
                </li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the Mo:Mos to be spicy.
                </li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.
                </li>
                <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander powder to make the filling taste a bit sour.
                </li>
                <li>Mix the spices with the meat.
                </li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too
                    dry (Nepalese love Mo:Mo with juicy fillings).
                </li>
                <li>Add finely chopped coriander.
                </li>
                <li>Mix them well.
                </li>

            </ul>
        <li>Making the Mo:Mo wrappers
            <ul>
                <li>Put the flour into a bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Add water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.
                </li>
                <li>Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.
                </li>
                <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough (the amount depends on how big you want the wrapping to be).
                </li>
                <li>With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don't make them too thin
                    or too thick) the size of a glass.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Cooking the Mo:Mos
            <p> <em>Now comes the most difficult part: packing and cooking the Mo:Mos!

                </em> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.
                </li>
                <li>Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.
                </li>
                <li>Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling
                    otherwise the Mo:Mos may break when steamed).
                </li>
                <li>Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the Mo:Mos from sticking.
                </li>
                <li>Put the Mo:Mos in a systematic order so that they don't touch each other.
                </li>
                <li>Steam for 20-30 mins.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
